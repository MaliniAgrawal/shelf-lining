 Shelf Lining Calculator

 Project Overview
The Shelf Lining Calculator is a serverless web application that helps users calculate cutting instructions for shelf lining based on given shelf dimensions. It utilizes AWS services to provide a scalable and efficient solution.

 Architecture
Frontend**: Hosted on Amazon S3
Backend**: AWS Lambda and API Gateway
Database**: Amazon DynamoDB

 Features
 Input shelf dimensions through a userfriendly web interface
 Calculate optimal cutting instructions for shelf lining
 Display results to the user on the webpage
 Store input dimensions and results in DynamoDB for future reference

 AWS Services Used
 Amazon S3 for static website hosting
 AWS Lambda for serverless compute
 Amazon API Gateway for RESTful API
 Amazon DynamoDB for data persistence

 How It Works
1. User enters shelf dimensions on the S3hosted website
2. Frontend sends data to API Gateway
3. API Gateway triggers Lambda function
4. Lambda function calculates cutting instructions
5. Results are sent back to the frontend and displayed
6. Lambda function also stores data in DynamoDB

 Benefits
 Serverless architecture ensures high availability and scalability
 Costeffective solution with payperuse pricing
 Easy to maintain and update

 Future Enhancements
 Add user authentication
 Implement history feature for registered users
 Optimize cutting algorithm for complex shelf shapes
